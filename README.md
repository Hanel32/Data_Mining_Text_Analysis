# ISLR_labs
Holding the lab code while working through ISLR for CSCE 489: Data Mining in Social Networks.

Here we go! I've officially started work on this book/language as well.

Overview:
----
- Chapter 1 ISLR           : Omitted, as it's an introduction to the book's layout.
- Chapter 2 ISLR           : The chapter 2 code-along R exercise in Introduction to Statistical Learning.
- Chapter 2 ISLR Assignment: The chapter 2 assignment after the code-along introduction to R.
